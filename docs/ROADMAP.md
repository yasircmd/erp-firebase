# Roadmap

New development after the migration. Keep this file current: update a
module's status after every finished step, then commit and push, so a
fresh session can continue from GitHub.

**Status values:** `not started` → `design` (doc being written) →
`design agreed` (owner has decided the open questions) → `building` →
`tested` (emulator suite, negative control, smoke) → `deployed` (logged in
[DEPLOY_LOG.md](DEPLOY_LOG.md)).

## Modules in development

| # | Module | Design doc | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Party Payments & Bill-wise Allocation (JV, CBT) | [PARTY_PAYMENTS.md](modules/PARTY_PAYMENTS.md) | deployed | Live 2026-09-25 ([DEPLOY_LOG.md](DEPLOY_LOG.md)). |
| 1 | Purchase Return / Debit Note | [PURCHASE_RETURN.md](modules/PURCHASE_RETURN.md) | deployed | Live 2026-09-25 ([DEPLOY_LOG.md](DEPLOY_LOG.md)). To do in the app: link it in Tree Management, set the Purchase Return Variance Account where needed. Cost-center fix for the variance line live 2026-09-26 (PR #6). |
| 2 | Sales Return / Credit Note | [SALES_RETURN.md](modules/SALES_RETURN.md) | deployed | Live 2026-09-25. To do in the app: link it in Tree Management. Change 2026-09-26: Sales Returns Account per Sales Type (Sales Invoice Configuration), replacing the company field; live 2026-09-26 (PR #7). To do in the app: set it on every Sales Type. |
| 3 | Vendor SOA | [VENDOR_SOA.md](modules/VENDOR_SOA.md) | deployed | Live 2026-09-25. To do in the app: link it in Tree Management. Merged into `main` 2026-09-26 (PR #5). |
| 4 | Customer SOA | [CUSTOMER_SOA.md](modules/CUSTOMER_SOA.md) | deployed | Live 2026-09-25 with #3. To do in the app: link it in Tree Management. |
| 5 | PDC Received and PDC Issued | [PDC.md](modules/PDC.md) | deployed | Live 2026-09-26: functions, screens and Hosting ([DEPLOY_LOG.md](DEPLOY_LOG.md)), plus the follow-up fixes (approving from Home Tasks; no "if they bounce" lines in the SOA). To do in the app: set both PDC clearing accounts in Company Master, and link the "PDC Received" / "PDC Issued" tree nodes to `PDCRECEIVED` / `PDCISSUED`. Merged into `main` 2026-09-26 (PR #9). |

**Order:** #0 first (the owner's priority, and the SOAs need it). Then the returns, which the SOAs report on, and
the SOAs last because they only read.

### #0 — tying payments to a party (decided)

An SOA lists a vendor's or customer's invoices, notes and payments.
Invoices carry `VendorID`/`CustomerID`, but payments and receipts are
posted through CBT, whose lines store only a GL account. No payment is
linked to a party, and nothing tracks what's paid or outstanding on an
invoice. Each vendor and customer does have its own
`TradePayablesAccountID`/`TradeReceivablesAccountID`. Options:

- **A. Tag CBT lines with a party:** an optional Vendor/Customer on CBT
  lines that hit payables or receivables. Small CBT change; works with
  shared or per-party accounts.
- **B. Per-party GL accounts:** the SOA reads the GL by the party's own
  account. No code change, but correct only if no two parties share an
  account.
- **C. New Vendor Payment / Customer Receipt modules** with allocation
  against invoices (outstanding tracking). Most complete; effectively two
  more modules.

Decision (owner, 2026-09-25): **A plus allocation.** JV and CBT lines are tagged with the vendor or customer, as a New Ref (for example an advance) or Against Ref (offsetting posted bills). Design: [PARTY_PAYMENTS.md](modules/PARTY_PAYMENTS.md).

## Follow-ups from new development

- [ ] **Customer credit control** (from Customer SOA decision C1): a
  credit limit on Customer Master and a warning on new Sales Orders for
  overdue or over-limit customers. Needs its own design doc.
- [x] **Party Payments UI check timing** (2026-09-26): it now waits for
  elements and options instead of fixed times; 3/3 right after an
  emulator restart (was 0/3).
- [x] **Faster deploys** (2026-09-26): inside tmux, batches of 20 instead
  of 6; invoker bindings 8 at a time instead of one by one
  (`tools/deploy-lib.sh`). First deploy with batches of 20 is untried:
  if it times out or hits API quota, rerun with `BATCH=10`.
- [x] **Release screens without a function deploy**
  ([SCREENS_ON_HOSTING.md](modules/SCREENS_ON_HOSTING.md)): live
  2026-09-26 ([DEPLOY_LOG.md](DEPLOY_LOG.md)). Owner's decisions: access
  check kept (B), Firestore, last 10 releases. Screens are in `screens/`;
  `getModuleFragment` serves the active release (first release
  `20260926T051858Z-b0cd09d`). Screen-only changes now go live with
  `tools/release-screens.sh`, not a function deploy.
- [x] **Home screen improvements** (owner, 2026-09-26; `public/index.html`,
  Hosting; live 2026-09-26, PR #8):
  1. User name (8rem) and role (6rem) are cut with an ellipsis; the full
     text is the user button's tooltip.
  2. Light/Dark mode moved into the user menu. The user menu isn't shown
     inside a module, so neither is the switch.
  3. **Configure Favourites** in the user menu: expands the whole tree
     and shows every module's star, with a banner and a Done button. It
     ends on Done, opening a module, Refresh, or a page reload (it's
     only held in memory). Stars no longer appear on hover. Outside the
     mode they're hidden, so a favourite still isn't marked in the tree.
  4. **Module search** box in the Home header: filters as you type
     (module names, and a folder name shows everything under it), opens
     the matching folders, shows "No modules match". Enter opens the
     module when there's exactly one match; Esc clears and restores the
     tree's open/closed state.
  5. Light mode highlights the hovered tree row (`#e2e8f0`), as dark mode
     does. Also fixed: row dividers (`divide-slate-700/800`, 83 uses
     including module tables) kept their dark colour in light mode.
  6. Expand/Collapse is a single icon button (double chevrons down/up,
     with a tooltip).
  Test: `functions/test/ui/home.ui.js` (6 checks, runs the real
  `index.html` with the Firebase SDK stubbed; no emulators). Negative
  controls, each caught: the light hover rule removed; the mode not
  ending on opening a module; search matching only the start of a name.
- [x] **Approving from Home Tasks** (owner report, 2026-09-26): PDC,
  Purchase Return and Sales Return screens drew an entry opened from Tasks
  before the user's rights had loaded, so no Approve/Reject appeared. They
  now redraw it when the rights arrive ([PDC.md](modules/PDC.md) → Fix).
  Same change: the SOA's "if pending PDCs bounce" lines removed (owner).
- [x] **One-company users: company chosen for them** (owner, 2026-09-26;
  live 2026-09-26, PR #10, [DEPLOY_LOG.md](DEPLOY_LOG.md)).
  1. A user assigned exactly one active company finds it already selected
     in every company dropdown on every screen: entry forms (also after
     New), list filters and report selectors. Done once in the shell
     (`public/index.html`, SINGLE-COMPANY DEFAULT), not per screen, since
     most screens are generated. It fills a company select whenever it's
     blank, and fires a non-bubbling `change` so the screen loads what
     depends on the company (accounts, items, eligible documents).
     Company selects on the 7 screens whose own change handler marked
     the form dirty now do so only for a user's change (`e.isTrusted`),
     so Back from an untouched New doesn't ask about unsaved changes
     (PR, Inventory PR, Sales Order, Purchase/Sales Return, both PDC
     screens; the three generated ones also edited in `legacy-gas/`).
  2. Home title: "ERP Module Hierarchy Tree - <their company>" for such a
     user (others still see the `01` company).
  3. **Owner's decision (2026-09-26):** master-data forms whose blank
     option is a real choice ("Shared across all companies" on Customer,
     Vendor, Item, COA, Org Units, Procurement and Sales Invoice setup)
     keep shared as the default, not the user's company.
  Users with two or more companies see no change. Tests:
  `functions/test/ui/singleCompany.ui.js` (41 screens as a one-company
  user, 4 as a two-company user; 45/45), a title check in `home.ui.js`
  (7/7). Negative controls, each caught: the fill turned off; the
  `isTrusted` guard removed on Purchase Return; the fill's event made to
  bubble (JV and GRN then asked about unsaved changes); the title's old
  "01 only" rule. Every other UI check reran green (fixture users all
  have one company): smoke 105/105, dynamic toggle 2/2, stock 12/12,
  party payments 3/3, returns 4/4 each, statements 4/4, PDC 8/8.
  Deployed: Hosting plus screen release `20260926T115827Z-d933363`; no
  functions.
- [ ] **Design: module/approval/voucher-type lists out of the code.** These
  lists are built into every function, so adding a module redeployed 19
  unchanged functions in the returns-and-statements deploy. Kept in
  Firestore, a new module would deploy only its own functions. Needs a
  design doc; touches ported modules (MIGRATION.md).

## Follow-ups from the migration

- [ ] **Data checks in the old Apps Script system** for the bugs still
  live there: deviations #5, #6, #8, #11, #12, #14–#16 and #18 in
  [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) → "Deviations from Code.gs". Don't use its
  "Recalculate Stock Ledger" (#18).
- [ ] **Back-fill Physical Counts** posted by the Apps Script system before
  deviation #7. While any exist, Data Reset's ledger rebuild refuses to
  run and names them.
- [ ] **Decisions on preserved quirks**, such as the missing company
  scoping in Approval Tracker and BOM, the company gaps in draft
  edit/delete, and the no-lock numbering and reservation races. All are
  listed in [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) → Status.
- [ ] **Retire the Apps Script project** once the owner is satisfied, then
  revisit the `no-cache` Hosting header (README → Caching).
